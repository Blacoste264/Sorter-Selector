<h1> Sorting-Algorithms-Selector </h1> </br>
<p> This is an application I am building to put my knowledge or sorting algorithms to the test! </p> </br>
<p> Went wayyy back to the basics for this one using only Node, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.</p> </br>

<h4> Enter in the numbers you would like to sort... </h4>
<h4> Let the magic unfold behind the scenes with 6 basic algorithms to choose from including Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merger, Quick and Heap!</h4>
<h4> A lovely gif will appear with an animation of that particular sorting method you chose, as well as an in-depth description if how it works. </h4>
